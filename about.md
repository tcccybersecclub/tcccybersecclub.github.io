Tidewater Community College Cybersecurity Club was established in the Fall of 2017. It was officially chartered by TCC in Spring of 2018.

Our mission is to encourage an active interest in Cybersecurity and promote professional networking, as well as support individual and team competitive sport experiences among students at Tidewater Community College. Working toward this goal, the active membership of the club will endeavor to increase their own knowledge of cyber skills by means of participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) events, penetration testing labs, cyber ranges, challenges, field trips, guest speakers, and seminars.
