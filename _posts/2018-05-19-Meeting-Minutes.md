## New Business
### Nominations for all offices will be due on 1 June.

If you are interested in serving in one of the available offices you may nominate any member in good standing (including yourself) by email or in the Discord channel by sending a DM to any Officer.

### ACM Chapter consideration

The ACM is an international organization with both Student Chapters and Professional Chapters. Having a Chapter at TCC would give us several advantages such as access to  professional whitepapers, guest speakers, and field trips to supporting companies. It has been proposed and approved that we ought to explore creating a Student Chapter, which requires a minimum of three officers, and ten individuals that will pledge to attend meetings and activities. The ten individuals do not need to join the ACM but are welcome to do so; membership for the officers is free.

If you are interested in assisting with creating the Student Chapter then please notify one of the officers as soon as possible.
